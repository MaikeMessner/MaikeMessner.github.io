  "mainText": "I am Maike and an illustrator/animator/graphic designer from MÃ¼nster. I mix analog and digital colors to create works with a hand-made look. It is important to me to leave room for emotions and to use charm and humor to make more or less complex topics more understandable. When I'm not doing something for my master's degree, I'm always listening to music or podcasts, meeting up with friends, trying out new hobbies (my favorite hobby of all) or going for a walk (preferably with friends). Interested in working with me?",
