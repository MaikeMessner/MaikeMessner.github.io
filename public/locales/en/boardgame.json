    "While I was studying abroad, I created a frame-by-frame animation about board games. It's made up of six scenes, each with morphing transitions. I used a different camera setting for each scene to create variety and dynamism. I made it using the software TVPaint.",
    "I also did some sound design, creating the audio in Audition and editing it in Premiere. The project has given me the opportunity to level up my technical skills in frame-by-frame animation and sound design."
