    "\"Dye\" is an exciting and atmospheric combination of a combinatorics game and a reaction game. During the day, you search for colonies of glowing bacteria in every direction to increase your chances of survival. But other creatures also want to get their hands on the coveted bacteria. Defend yourself with precise attacks and protect your bioluminescence!",
    "When it's get dark, you must fight for survival: predators will recognise you as prey if you don't imitate their coloured glow quickly enough. If your camouflage fails, you will lose your precious colours â€” and ultimately your life."
